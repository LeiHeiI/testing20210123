	  <h4>Arriving at Louisville</h4>
	  <p>
Here we are at the Kentucky Exposition Center. We first went to Beijing to practice with the team from the High School Attached to Beijing University of Technology. 
</p>
<p>
Then we transferred in Chicago airport and finally reached Louisville after a long flight. (The second video is sooo funny, we could hardly hold our flag because of the strong wind lol)

	  <h4>Getting ready</h4>
	  <p>Right after registration our team started to set up our booth, to test our robot in the Practice Field, and to draw a map to locate the positions of all target alliances. And I started to talk with our alliances to find the best strategies in the matches. </p>

      	  <h4>Robot Skills Challenge</h4>
	  <p>We took the Robot Skills Challenge before taking any qualification matches. It is an additional ranking called World Skills and provides a reference to our target alliances how high our robot can score alone in one single match. (You can see from my face that we did some silly little mistakes though lol)

      <h4>Great match</h4>
	  <p>
    And here comes the qualification matches. Three of our Drive Team members (including me being the strategist) were soooo nervous and we had made some careless mistakes such as forgetting to change batteries and finding the wrong alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, we quickly adjusted our conditions and performed well in the matches. (Btw this match is really exciting you should check it out!)

      	  <h4>Rewards</h4>
	  <p>WE got into the SEMI-FINAL!!!! 
    </p>
    <p>
    It is so surprising and this is the first time for me to choose our alliance!!! After a fierce negotiation with lots of teams, we chose team Russia at last. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Although we eventually lost in this round, we got the only Build Award in the Middle School Division and I felt genuinely grateful for the warm-hearted and amiable judges!! (I was still holding the cookie-flavored ice-cream while getting the award lol)
