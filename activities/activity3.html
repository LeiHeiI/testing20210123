	  <h3>Taiwan International Science Fair (TISF)</h3>
	  <h4>Grade 9 | Taipei, Taiwan</h4>
      <h4>January 2018</h4>
      <p>
We are heading to Taiwan today!! 
</p>
<p>This is the first time for me to take part in an international innovative competition. Although we just lost in the Macao ISEF election and I am a bit under the weather these days, we have done full preparation and improved our mistakes in the election. 
</p>
<p>Let’s see if we can do better in Taiwan! (In our school we call this competition “mini ISEF” coz many winners will take this as a trial before real ISEF)

	  <h4>Competition</h4>
	  <p>
	  As usual, we set up our booth and competition started! During the Judge Day we talked to at least 5 judges non-stop. I was very nervous, but luckily this time I partnered with my robotics team leader and her calmness also affected me.

<h4>Rewards</h4>
	  <p>
We felt really good at the end of the Judge Day and to our surprise, we got the Fourth Prize in Engineering section!</p>
<p>There were only two awards presented to Engineering section this year and the other winner was Daniel Kang from Guam, who won the Best of Category Award in Material Science in 2018 Intel ISEF after winning First Prize in 2018 TISF. </p>

(UPDATE: He just got into Stanford omgggggg I wish I can become someone like him when I grow up)
