	  <h4>Arrival</h4>
	  <p>
After having an extremely long flight, we arrived at Phoenix at night. We are starving, so our teacher brings us to a bar(it is the only restaurant opened near our hotel).    </p>
<p>
We enjoyed cheese burger and of course ICED LEMON TEA, aka the “most popular drink” in the bar lollll (just ignore the BEER sign on our photo, we had lemon tea instead lol )

<h4>Getting ready</h4>
	  <p>
As usual, we set up our booth and poster. And we start our numerous rehearsals and practices. We have got 2 days for practicing and we made use of them effectively. (The YouTube video is a recording of our rehearsal, sorry we often burst into laughter loll)</p>

<h4>Judging Day</h4>
	  <p>
We are so nervous before the judges come, but surprisingly we quickly calm down as soon as we start our presentation. Today we chat with 14 judges in total and we are really exhausted, but we try our best to stay enthusiastic and excited during the whole process.</p>
<p>
Overall, we think that we have done a pretty good job! Hope that the result is satisfactory….I am so nervous….

<h4>Grand Awards Ceremony</h4>
	  <p>
We didn’t get any Special Award yesterday and I was kind of disappointed. My heart is beating so fast when the host is announcing the winners, but I feel that all my efforts and tears have paid off when my name is announced through the speaker!!! </p>  
<p>
My dream comes true!!! I got a Grand Third Prize in Engineering Mechanics!!! I feel so thankful for all the support and love I received from my team, my school and my family.

<h4>Return</h4>
	  <p>Right after we return to Macao, the Chief Executive of the Macao Education Bureau and our school principals are waiting for us at the wharf. We cheer, we cry, I feel that this is the best day in my life so far.</p>
<p>
(In Photo 3, the reason why the boy always opens his mouth while taking photos is that he wants his chin to look slimmer lol)
