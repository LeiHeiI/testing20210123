      <div class="cardleft">My interest in the amazing power of engineering first formed when I read a comic book about steam engines during my childhood.

In particular, my aim is to study Mechanical Engineering because it is essential knowledge included in almost every engineering project, which is the sole driving force to make the world a better place.</div>
