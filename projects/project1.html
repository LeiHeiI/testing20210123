	  <h3>Chinese Dougong brackets</h3>
	  <h4>Grade 10 | Computer Club</h4>
      <h4>Winter 2019</h4>
      <p>
	      Dougong bracket is an ancient Chinese building structure that really blows my mind! 
	  </p>
	      <p>
	It acts to transfer the stress from rooftop to the main pillar and to ensure the overall stability of the rooftop. It was invented in the Warring States period and has served for more than 2500 years!
       </p>
       <p>
	      This structure is a really complicated one, so I first drew a 2D draft before building it.

      <p>From 3D design to programming, this is the first robot which I played a vital role in every step of its construction process. This is a robot for 2016-2017 Velocity Vortex Game. It shoots balls and presses beacons to score in the game.
