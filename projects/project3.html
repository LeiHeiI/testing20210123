	  <h3>Story outline:</h3>
      <p>
	  Bamboo (portrayed by Daniel Fong) is a little boy who dreamed of meeting beautiful princesses after listening to his Grandma’s (portrayed by Kenneth Chan) bedtime stories. He decided to find those princesses together with his friend Andyson (portrayed by Andyson U).
	  </p>
	  <p>
However, he soon found out that both the mermaid (portrayed by Dickson Wong) and Snow White (portrayed by Ryan Lai) were devastated because the forest and the ocean were polluted. </p>

We, human beings, cannot ignore the planet’s S.O.S. signals anymore and need to take action to save our environment!</p>

	  <h3>Love yourself, be yourself</h3> 
	  <h4>Grade 12 | Inner-school Pui Ching’s Got Talent 2020-2021</h4>
      <h4>Winter 2020</h4>
	  <h3>Story outline:</h3>
      <p>
Bamboo (portrayed by Daniel Fong) was the nerdiest student in S6A. Originally, he enjoyed being a nerd because his friends supported him and he was confident in being himself.	  </p>
	  <p>
	  However, he accidentally fell in love with Dickie (portrayed by Dickson Wong), who was the most beautiful and stylish girl in school. Bamboo decided to transform into a popular guy to be Dickie’s date at the Senior Prom. 
	  </p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Dickie actually loved who Bamboo originally was because she also wanted to be herself and didn’t follow fashion trends like the other girls did. Eventually, both of them realized that it was most important to love themselves, and be themselves.
