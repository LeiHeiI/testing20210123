<h2>Chatting with Stanford student, 2016 Intel ISEF Top Winner—Kathy Liu</h2>
<h3 style="color: grey;">2018/9/24</h3>
<p>
Today, 2016 Intel ISEF Top Winner Kathy Liu paid a visit to our school FabLAB. Luckily, I was working on my project at that moment, so I stopped by and listened to her sharing about university applications and her experience in doing research. 
</p>
<p>
She mentioned a metaphor of “mountains and peak” to describe what kind of students top universities are looking for. “Mountains” are great academic performance and a variety of participations in art, music, sports, and volunteering work. The “peak” is a showcase of significant interest and talent (through awards and international competitions) that can reflect your potential in your future professional field. 
</p>
<p>
Through this short meeting, I feel that Kathy is a charismatic person with great sense of humor. I’ll bear her advices in mind and I genuinely want to become someone like her when I grow up.
