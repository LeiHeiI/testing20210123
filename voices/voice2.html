<h2>Reflection after joining the Public Consultation for “Medium and Long-term Plan of Non-Tertiary Education” (2021-2030)</h2>
<h3 style="color: grey;">2021/1/9</h3>
<p>
My sister did not attend special school. Instead, she was part of the integrated education programme in which she could receive special treatment while participating in mainstream education. In this session of the public consultation, two principals suggested possible improvements in integrated education, including special assessment method and distribution of counsellors. I am so glad to see more and more Macau people are working hard to change our society into an open-minded community.
