<h2>Chatting with Nobel Prize Winner--Erwin Neher</h2>
<h3 style="color: grey;">2019/5/22</h3>
<p>
Erwin Neher is a biophysicist who was awarded, along with Bert Sakmenn, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He visited our school FabLAB and Oliver and I introduced our ISEF project to him. I have never thought that I could meet a Nobel Prize winner and it is my great honor to chat with him.</p>
<p>
After his visit, he gave a talk about his discoveriesâ€”ion channels in cells in the school Hall. Although many of my classmates fell asleep, I stayed awake to pay attention to every detail of his research process. Apart from all scientific technique, he mentioned conscientiousness as the most important quality of a researcher.
