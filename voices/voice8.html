<h2>A linguistic game for autistic children</h2>
<h3 style="color: grey;">2020/2/3</h3>
<p>
Recently, I learned to create mobile application prototype using AppInventor, so I tried to create a linguistic game simulating daily dialogues because I discovered that most of the autistic kids do not know how to react while facing others’ questions, even those as simple as “how’s your day?”. To capture the attention of the autistic kids, I make use of a cute puppy to have conversations with them, hoping that they are more willing to share their thoughts.

Also, I noticed that most of the autistic kids had come across difficulties in memorizing vocabulary, so I added an additional vocab game to help them with their homework. The vocabulary bank covers topics such as animals, plants, and furniture according to their school textbooks.
