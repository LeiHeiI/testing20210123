<h2>A linguistic game for autistic children</h2>
<h3 style="color: grey;">2020/2/3</h3>
<p>
Recently, I learned to create mobile application prototype using AppInventor, so I tried to create a linguistic game simulating daily dialogues. To capture the attention of the autistic kids, I make use of a cute puppy to have conversations with them, hoping that they are more willing to share their thoughts.

<p>
Also, I noticed that most of the autistic kids had come across difficulties in memorizing vocabulary, so I added an additional vocab game to help them with their homework.

***Words in pink in the screenshots are translated into English, the game is originally in Chinese.
