<h2>Sharing my experience in joining 2019 Intel ISEF</h2>
<h3 style="color: grey;">2020/4/5</h3>
<p>
This year, the theme of World Autism Awareness Day is the Transition to Adulthood. This theme is truly meaningful to me since my sister becomes a freshman in Macau Polytechnic Institute in 2020. Without the protection and assistance of integrated education in high school, she faces lot of significant challenges while trying to adapt to the new environment and meeting new people.</p>
<p>
To be honest, she is not doing great because it is the first time for her to take the entire control of her schoolwork. Transition to adulthood isnâ€™t easy for everyone, especially for those who need special help.
