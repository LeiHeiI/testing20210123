<h2>Sharing Jullia Suhyoung Lim’s talk—Autism is simply another approach to life</h2>
<h3 style="color: grey;">2021/2/9</h3>
<p>I have browsed through the Internet in both Chinese and English to find sensible technological approaches to autism, but Jullia’s project really gives me a surprise. When my autistic sister was young, she had taken trainings based on ACC systems (something like <a href="https://lifezest.co/best-assistive-technology-for-autism/">https://lifezest.co/best-assistive-technology-for-autism/</a>) in local hospital. To be honest, the trainings were not that effective, so my sister quitted at the age of 8 and my parents started to teach her by themselves.</p>
<p>Thanks to the advance of technologies, AR can now be used in autism treatment and it fulfils the desperate need of autistic children—how to react in real-world social settings. Even after my sister has graduated from high school, these are still the biggest challenges for her, such as ordering food in restaurants, asking for help in the public, and so on.</p>
